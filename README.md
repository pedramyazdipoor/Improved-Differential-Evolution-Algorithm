## An improved differential evolution algorithm and its application in optimization problem

This repository is related to the implementation of this [article](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00500-020-05527-x).
In this project I developed a modified differential evolution algorithm featuring a unique mutation vector and a new operator called Opposition-Based Learning
addressing exploration ability, convergence accuracy and convergence speed. The main idea of OBL is to evaluate the fitness values of the current point and its
reverse point in order to correct the convergence direction and select the better solutions.
